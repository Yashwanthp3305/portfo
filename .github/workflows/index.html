#The story

King Indradyumna ruled over the Malava Country in Satya Yuga. 
King Indradyumna was a devotee of Lord Vishnu. 
In his dreams, Vishnu told Indradyumna to build a temple for him. 
Indradyumna sent his priest, Vidyapati, to find the deity. 
Vidyapati found the deity, Nilmadhav, in a cave in the Nilachal Hills. 
Vidyapati married Vishwavasu's daughter, Lalita, to convince Vishwavasu to show him the deity. 
Indradyumna traveled to Odisha to find the idol. 
The temple was buried under sand after Brahma meditated for a long time. 
Indradyumna was told by a celestial voice to carve idols from a floating log on the seashore. 
Indradyumna built a temple and enshrined the wooden images of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra.
